### 1.4 ###

The Internet Archive presents The Official Wayback Machine Extension. With the power of the Wayback Machine, you can go back in time to see how a website has changed and evolved through the history of the Web!


Functions include seeing the oldest or newest version of a website, or a calendar of every past archive. There's also the "Site Map" feature that will draw a pie graph of the past history of pages of a site.

The toolbar button shows you how many snapshots of the website you're visiting are in the Wayback Machine, and the date of the latest snapshot in the popup window.

You can right-click, then "Open in Wayback Machine" in the context menu. Try it while over a link.

Whenever you encounter a "dead link" (a.k.a 404 Not Found) page, this extension will automatically provide a link to a saved version in the Wayback Machine.

Most features work without requiring an account, but if you do create an account, you'll be able to archive any website easily with just a single tap of a button.

Convenient 3rd-party functions for searching for Related Tweets, Alexa, and Whois for looking up domain names, as well as sharing links on social media websites.
