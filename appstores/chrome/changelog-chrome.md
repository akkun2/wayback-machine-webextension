Reduce annoying 404 pages by automatically checking for an archived copy in the Wayback Machine.
The official Chrome extension of the Wayback Machine from the Internet Archive.

Detects dead pages, 404s, DNS failures and other Web breakdowns (HTTP error codes 408, 410, 451, 500, 502, 503, 504, 509, 520, 521, 523, 524, 525, and 526)

If we have a Wayback Machine archive of a URL that returns those error codes we will offer it to you.

In addition you can view a site map of Web sites based on archives of URLs from those sites archived in the Wayback Machine.
